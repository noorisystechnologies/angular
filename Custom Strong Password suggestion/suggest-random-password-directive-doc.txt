How to Use


1. Create a directive using ng g directive directive-name
2. Copy the code in suggest-password.directive.ts 
3. Bind the directive selector as property binding and bind with formGroup name.

<button class="btn btn-secondary" [appSuggestPassword]="your-formGroup-name" >Suggest me</button>

4. Required: The password input formControlName should be password so that the directive gets formControlName and set the random
generated password on the password input.

5. If you have set another formControlName then you have to set the same in generatePassword() on
line :  this.passwordFormGroup.get('you-password-input-formControlName')?.setValue(password);

Result: On button click with directive directive will generate 12 digit Alphanumeric random password and set the value to the
password input, If you click again it will generate new password.
